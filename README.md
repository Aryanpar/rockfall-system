# 🧠 AI Rockfall Prediction App

A web-based machine-learning application that predicts **rockfall risk levels** based on environmental and geological inputs. The goal of this project is to provide an accessible decision-support tool for engineers, researchers, students, and disaster-management teams to assess potential hazards and improve safety in hilly and mountainous regions.

This project uses an AI model to analyze user-provided data and estimate the likelihood of rockfall events.

## 📌 How It Works

1. The user enters terrain / environment-related inputs  
2. The AI model processes the data  
3. A **risk likelihood prediction** is generated  
4. The system provides a readable interpretation  

The goal is to assist — not replace — professional geological assessment.
